- Accent color: Yellow (#FFC107), used sparingly for highlights, shift confirmations and call-to-action elements.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for a modern yet welcoming and legible appearance.
- Use clear, simple icons to represent shift types and actions (e.g., calendar for schedule, checkmark for confirmation).
- Employ a clean, card-based layout to display shifts, making information easily digestible at a glance.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user actions (e.g., confirming a shift). Keep animations minimal to maintain a professional feel.
